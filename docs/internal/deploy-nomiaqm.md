# Deploy `nomiaqm.com`

This repo contains a static marketing site in `site/`.

## Recommended Hosting

Use Cloudflare Pages with GitHub integration, or Cloudflare Workers Static Assets if your Cloudflare project is configured to run `npx wrangler deploy`.

Why:

- `site/index.html` is static and does not need a server runtime.
- GitHub integration deploys automatically after each push to `main`.
- Cloudflare can manage `nomiaqm.com` DNS, HTTPS, CDN, cache headers, and future redirects in one place.
- If the site later needs edge logic, Workers Static Assets can serve the same `site/` directory.

## Cloudflare Pages Settings

Create a Pages project from GitHub:

- Repository: `aqm857886159/Nomi`
- Production branch: `main`
- Framework preset: `None`
- Build command: `pnpm run build`
- Build output directory: `site`

The root `pnpm run build` command is intentionally scoped to the static marketing site so Cloudflare Pages can deploy without application runtime environment variables. Use `pnpm run build:app` when you need to build the full Nomi application.

If the Cloudflare project has a deploy command configured, use:

- Deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy`

The repository root contains `wrangler.toml`, which points Wrangler Static Assets at `site/`.

## Custom Domain

Use the apex domain:

- Domain: `nomiaqm.com`

For an apex domain, add `nomiaqm.com` as a Cloudflare zone and point the domain registrar nameservers to the two nameservers Cloudflare provides.

After the nameservers are active:

1. Open Cloudflare Dashboard.
2. Go to Workers & Pages.
3. Open the Nomi Pages project.
4. Go to Custom domains.
5. Add `nomiaqm.com`.
6. Cloudflare will create the required DNS record and issue HTTPS automatically.

Optional:

- Add `www.nomiaqm.com` as a second custom domain.
- Redirect `www.nomiaqm.com` to `https://nomiaqm.com/`.
